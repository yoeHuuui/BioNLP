## Get Data

In this project, we had finished somethings.
First, we used the PubTator API to get the annotation information in article abstract. You can use __Esearch.sh__ and __PubTator.sh__ to finish!
Next, we need to get sentence which contains least two entities. You can use __Key_Word_Search.py__ and __Transform.py__ to finish!
Finally, the NPMI can evaluate the frequency of two entities in one sentence. And dependecy tree can analyse the relationship in two entites. You can use __NPMI_Count.py__ and __Tree.py__ to finish!

## Analyse

First, We need to calculta the number of entities, and compared entities in database. You can use __Calculate_Entity.py__ and __Compare_Dataset.py__ to finish!

To anlyse the network, __Link_analysis.ipynb__ can plot the figure and find the common gene in two dataset.
